## Side-Notes
* First of all, these configs are free to use!
* I hope it's ok that these modifications are reasonable after all, since mods shall improve the game at all.
* standard rates (100% efficiency set) --> the hitchy has 400 units snacks and 100 units max soil capacity means 4 units snacks to 1 unit soil in capacity
* I tried to follow the original Hitchy settings and added some improvements on the mod parts, better parts, fancier looking, improved functionality
* some parts have a higher power usage but also convert/recycle soil (same capacity of soil tho)
* I made AutoShutdown = true just to make sure snacks do not waste into space or on the celestial body :)
* the K&K Greenhouse Container has the standard rate like the Hitchy but no storage of snacks or soil so make sure you have these containers/parts

Feedback is very welcome, happy soil converting! :)

## ToDo
- [x] more Koffee!
- [ ] more parts (eventually)
- [ ] more recycling-fun!
